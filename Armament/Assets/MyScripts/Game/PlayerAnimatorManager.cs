             * we don't want to do anything and solely rely on the PhotonView component to synchronize the transform and 
             * animator components we've setup earlier. But, why having then to enforce PhotonNetwork.IsConnected == true 
             * in our if statement? eh eh :) because during development, we may want to test this prefab without being 
             * connected. In a dummy scene for example, just to create and validate code that is not related to networking 
             * features per se. And so with this additional expression, we will allow input to be used if we are not 
             * connected. It's a very simple trick and will greatly improve your workflow during development.
